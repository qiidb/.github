# QiiDB

"Qii" of QiiDB comes from the concept of Chinese Philosophy "ÁÇÅ".

QiiDB is a Git-based open-data database. It's different from any other databases because it doesn't provider any capabilities to operate or storage data. QiiDB is just the place storages entity metadata described by Markdown and YAML files.

Data from QiiDB are open, which means that everyone can use them whatever they wish. Such as personal blogs, wiki sites, knowledge graphs, and so on.
