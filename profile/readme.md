# QiiDB

"Qii" of QiiDB comes from the concept of Chinese Philosophy "ÁÇÅ".

QiiDB is a Git-based open-data database. It's different from any other databases because it doesn't provide any capabilities to operate or storage data. QiiDB is just the place storages entity metadata described by Markdown and YAML files.

Data from QiiDB is open, which means that people can use it whatever they wish. Such as personal blogs, wiki sites, knowledge graphs, and so on.
